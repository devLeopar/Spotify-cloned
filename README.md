## Usage
First you need to login the app with your spotify account. Don't worry it will not record any private information or save them to anywhere!!

You `must` play and pause a song with any of your devices before playing on this app because it needs to get active device. It does not create new device for you (It doesn't use spotify web SDK but use Spotify Web API)

Then you can choose the song with the list and see that song plays on your device.

### For information
If you have any idea to improve this app further, this is welcomed to pull requests
